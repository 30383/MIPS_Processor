# MIPS Processor Implementation in Verilog

## Overview

This project implements a 5-stage pipelined MIPS processor in Verilog, designed to be synthesized and simulated using Xilinx Vivado. The processor includes the following pipeline stages:

1. **Instruction Fetch (IF)**
2. **Instruction Decode (ID)**
3. **Execution (EX)**
4. **Memory Access (MEM)**
5. **Write Back (WB)**

In addition to the basic pipeline stages, the processor includes hazard detection and data forwarding units to handle pipeline hazards efficiently.

## Project Structure

The project consists of several Verilog modules, each representing different components of the MIPS processor:

- **IF Stage:** Manages the program counter (PC) and instruction memory.
- **ID Stage:** Decodes instructions and handles register file access.
- **EX Stage:** Executes ALU operations and computes memory addresses.
- **MEM Stage:** Performs data memory operations.
- **WB Stage:** Writes results back to the register file.
- **Hazard Detection Unit:** Identifies and manages hazards in the pipeline to prevent incorrect instruction execution.
- **Data Forwarding Unit:** Resolves data hazards by forwarding data between pipeline stages.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Xilinx Vivado:** This project is designed to be synthesized and simulated in Xilinx Vivado. Make sure you have Vivado installed and properly configured.
Certainly! Hereâ€™s the full README text in plain text format:

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/30383/MIPS_Processor.git
   cd MIPS_Processor

2. **Open Vivado:**
   Launch Xilinx Vivado and create a new project.

3. **Add Verilog Files:**
   Add the Verilog files from the `src/` directory to your Vivado project.
   
3a. **Alternate**
   Alternatively, copy the files included in the folder. Open Xilinx Vivado and open the `CA_Assignment_2.xpr` file as a new project.

4. **Run Simulation:**
   Use the testbench provided in the `tb/` directory to simulate the MIPS processor. This will allow you to verify the functionality of the processor.

5. **Synthesize and Implement:**
   Once the design is verified via simulation, synthesize and implement the design on a supported FPGA device.

### Directory Structure

- `src/`: Contains the Verilog source files for the MIPS processor.
- `tb/`: Contains testbench files for simulating and verifying the design.
- `constraints/`: Xilinx Vivado constraint files for FPGA implementation.

## Features

- **5-Stage Pipeline:** Implements a 5-stage pipeline typical of MIPS processors.
- **Hazard Detection:** Includes logic to detect and manage hazards to ensure correct instruction execution.
- **Data Forwarding:** Implements data forwarding to mitigate data hazards, allowing instructions to proceed without unnecessary stalls.
